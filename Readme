1. Why this program is made
To understand nested loops in the C programming language.
To learn how loop counters work together (outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns).
To practice pattern printing logic, which strengthens problem-solving skills.
To demonstrate how user input controls program output.
Commonly used as a basic programming exercise for beginners.

2. Utility (Uses of this program)
Helps beginners grasp looping concepts easily.
Used in academic learning (schools, colleges, competitive exams).
Builds foundation for complex algorithms involving loops and conditions.
Useful in understanding matrix traversal and data visualization logic.
Enhances logical thinking required for coding interviews.
Can be adapted for printing tables, charts, or structured data.

3. Future Scope
Can be extended to create different patterns (reverse triangle, pyramid, diamond).
Can be modified to include conditions (odd/even numbers, prime numbers).
Forms the base for 2D array (matrix) operations.
Useful in developing graphics and game logic where structured output is needed.
Helps in understanding algorithm design and optimization.
Can be applied in real-world applications like reports, dashboards, and formatted outputs.
